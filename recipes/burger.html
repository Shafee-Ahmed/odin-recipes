            <ul>
                <li>Onion: You can’t have a fried onion burger without onions. I like to use sweet onions, but any good
                    onion will work.</li>
                <li>Burger: Ground beef, sliced cheddar cheese and hamburger buns. I like to use my homemade hamburger
                    buns which are amazing. However, use whatever hamburger buns you like.</li>
                <li>Flavorings: The flavorings are simple – Kosher salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Fats: Even though the ground beef contains fats, this recipe uses a combination of unsalted butter
                    and vegetable oil for the cooking.</li>

            <h2 class="bur-step">How to Make Ramen Step-By-Step :</h2>
            <p><b>Step 1</b><br>I started by cutting the onion in half, pole to pole, and slicing it into ⅛-inch slices.
                Then, I combined the sliced onions with some Kosher salt and placed them in a wire mesh strainer set
                over a bowl.</p>
            <p><b>Step 2</b><br>After about 30 minutes, I dumped the onions into a clean dish towel and squeezed them
                dry. I was amazed at the amount of liquid that came out.</p>
            <p><b>Step 3</b><br>I started by dividing the onions into four separate piles on a rimmed baking sheet.
                Then, I formed the ground beef into four tightly packed 4-ounce balls and placed the balls on top of the
                onion piles. </p>
            <p><b>Step 4</b><br>Next, I used my hand to flatten the ground beef into the onions, ensuring that the
                onions stuck to the beef. Finally, I sprinkled the patties with some salt and pepper.</p>
            <p><b>Step 5</b><br>I melted the butter with the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Then, I
                carefully slipped a spatula under each burger and transferred it to the skillet, onion side down.I
                cooked the burgers for about 10 minutes until the onions were golden brown and began to crisp around the
                edges.</p>
            <p><b>Step 6</b><br>I cooked the burgers for about 10 minutes until the onions were golden brown and began
                to crisp around the edges.</p>
            <p><b>Step 7</b><br>Next, I increased the heat to high. I carefully flipped the burgers and cooked them on
                high for several minutes until they were nicely browned.</p>
            <p><b>Step 8</b><br>Meanwhile, I lightly buttered and toasted the hamburger buns and placed the sliced
                cheese on the bottom buns. When the burgers were done, I placed them on the cheese, onion side up. Our
                topping of choice was just mayonnaise, but you could put whatever you wanted on the burgers.</p><br>
